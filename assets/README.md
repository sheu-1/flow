# App Assets

This folder should contain the required images referenced by `app.json`:

- `icon.png` — App icon (recommended 1024x1024 PNG with square aspect, no transparency).
- `splash.png` — Splash screen image (any size; commonly 1242x2436 or larger).

You can quickly grab Expo’s template assets from a new project created via `npx create-expo-app` and copy the default `icon.png` and `splash.png` here.

Once these files exist, `expo doctor` and EAS builds will pass the asset checks.
