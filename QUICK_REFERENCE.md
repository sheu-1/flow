# Quick Reference Guide - Transaction Improvements

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. **Enhanced SMS Categorization** ✅

### 2. **Pagination** ✅
- 100 records per page
- `<` and `>` navigation controls
- Page indicators (e.g., "Page 2 of 5")
- Record range display (e.g., "101-200 of 450")

### 3. **Unified Filtering** ✅
- Consistent across Dashboard and Reports
- Date range filters work reliably
- Category and type filters accurate

### 4. **Loading Indicators** ✅
- Visual feedback when filters applied
- "Applying filters..." message with spinner
- Non-blocking UI updates

## 📝 Message Categorization Rules

### Airtime Purchases
```
Keywords: "airtime", "minutes"
Type: Money Out (Expense)
Category: "Airtime"

Example:
"You bought Ksh 50.00 of airtime"
→ Expense: Ksh 50.00, Category: Airtime
```

### Data Purchases
```
Keywords: "data", "bundles", "MB", "GB"
Type: Money Out (Expense)
Category: "Data"

Example:
"You bought 500MB data bundle for Ksh 20.00"
→ Expense: Ksh 20.00, Category: Data
```

### Fuliza Repayments
```
Keywords: "pay" + "Fuliza", "repay Fuliza", "used to pay outstanding Fuliza"
Type: Money Out (Expense)
Category: "Fuliza Repayment"

Example:
"Ksh 95.33 has been used to fully pay your outstanding Fuliza"
→ Expense: Ksh 95.33, Category: Fuliza Repayment
```

### Fuliza Issuance (Fee Only)
```
Keywords: "Fuliza amount is", "Access Fee charged"
Type: Money Out (Expense)
Category: "Fuliza Fee"
Amount: ONLY the access fee (NOT borrowed amount)

Example:
"Fuliza M-PESA amount is Ksh 30.00. Access Fee charged Ksh 0.30"
→ Expense: Ksh 0.30 (NOT Ksh 30.00), Category: Fuliza Fee
```
